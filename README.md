## Developer Notes for Various HEP Projects
* [Exa.TrkX](Exa.TrkX) (HEP advanced tracking algorithms at the exascale)
  is a DOE project for reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles
  from a collision event as they fly through a HEP detector.
* [NOvA](NOvA) (NuMI Off-axis ve Appearance) experiment is designed to study
  neutrino oscillations using the particle collision event data recorded by
  two accelerator-based detectors.
